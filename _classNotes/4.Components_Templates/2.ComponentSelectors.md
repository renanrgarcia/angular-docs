# Component Selectors

The component selector is a string that Angular uses to identify a component within a template. It is defined in the `@Component` decorator of the component class. The selector can take various forms, including:

- **Element Selector**: This is the most common form, where the selector is defined as a custom HTML element. For example, if a component has a selector of `app-header`, it can be used in a template as `<app-header></app-header>`.
- **Attribute Selector**: In this form, the selector is defined as an attribute. For example, a component with a selector of `[appHighlight]` can be used as `<div appHighlight></div>`.
- **Class Selector**: This form uses a class name as the selector. For example, a component with a selector of `.app-card` can be used as `<div class="app-card"></div>`.
- **Combination Selector**: Selectors can also be combined. For example, a component with a selector of `app-button[primary]` can be used as `<app-button primary></app-button>`.
  To use a component in a template, you simply include its selector in the HTML of that template. Angular then replaces the selector with the component's template and logic during the rendering process.
