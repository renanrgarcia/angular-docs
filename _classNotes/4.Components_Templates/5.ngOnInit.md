# ngOnInit Lifecycle Hook

The `ngOnInit` lifecycle hook is a method in Angular components that is called once, after the first `ngOnChanges`. It is part of Angular's component lifecycle and is typically used for component initialization tasks, such as fetching data or setting up initial state.

## When to Use ngOnInit

- **Initialization Logic**: Use `ngOnInit` to perform any initialization logic that requires the component's inputs to be set.
- **Data Fetching**: It is a common place to fetch data from services or APIs when the component is created.
- **Avoid Constructor Logic**: Avoid putting complex logic in the constructor; instead, use `ngOnInit` for better separation of concerns.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import { Component, OnInit } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
  selector: "app-example",
  templateUrl: "./example.component.html",
  styleUrls: ["./example.component.css"],
})
export class ExampleComponent implements OnInit {
  // Implement OnInit interface to use ngOnInit
  data: any;

  constructor() {}

  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.fetchData();
  }

  fetchData() {
    // Simulate an API call
    setTimeout(() => {
      this.data = { message: "Hello from ngOnInit!" };
    }, 1000);
  }
}
```

## ngOnInit vs Constructor

- **Constructor**: Used for simple initialization, such as setting default values for properties. It is called when the component is instantiated.
- **ngOnInit**: Used for more complex initialization that may depend on Angular's bindings being resolved. It is called after the constructor and after Angular has set all input properties.
