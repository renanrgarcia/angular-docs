# Host Component

In Angular, a host component is a component that contains and uses another component within its template. The host component is responsible for providing the context in which the child component operates, including passing data to it via inputs and handling events emitted by the child component.

```css
/* Styles applied to the host component element */
:host {
  display: block;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  padding: 16px;
  margin: 16px 0;
  border-radius: 8px;
  background-color: #f9f9f9;
}
```
