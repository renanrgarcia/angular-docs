# Content Projection

Content projection is a powerful feature in Angular that allows you to insert dynamic content into a component from outside that component. This is particularly useful for creating reusable components that can display different content based on the context in which they are used.

## Basic Content Projection

To implement basic content projection, you use the `<ng-content />` directive in your component's template. This directive acts as a placeholder for the content that will be projected into the component.

```typescript
import { Component, Input } from "@angular/core";
@Component({
  selector: "app-dashboard-item",
  templateUrl: "./dashboard-item.component.html",
  standalone: true,
})
export class DashboardItemComponent {
  @Input() title!: string;
  @Input() image!: { src: string; alt: string };
}
```

```html
<div class="dashboard-item">
  <article>
    <header>
      <img [src]="image.src" [alt]="image.alt" />
      <h2>{{ title }}</h2>
    </header>
    <ng-content />
  </article>
</div>
```
