# Project Structure

- On Angular projects, the typical structure includes the following key directories:
  - `.vscode`: Contains Visual Studio Code settings specific to the project.
  - `src/app`: Contains the main application code, including components, services, and modules.
  - `node_modules`: Contains all the dependencies installed via npm.
  - `public`: Contains static assets like images, stylesheets, and the main HTML file.
- Configuration files are also present at the root level:
  - `package.json`: Lists project dependencies and scripts for building and running the application.
  - `package-lock.json`: Locks the versions of dependencies to ensure consistent installs across environments.
  - `.editorconfig`: Configuration file for code editors to maintain consistent coding styles.
  - `angular.json`: Configuration file for Angular CLI, defining project structure and build options.
  - `tsconfig.json, tsconfig.app.json, tsconfig.spec.json`: TypeScript configuration files for the main application, app-specific settings, and testing respectively. They define how TypeScript compiles the code.
- Starting on Angular v.20, the "component" word is no longer used in the file and directory names. Instead, the term "directive" is used to refer to components, which are still the same in functionality but reflect a shift in terminology.
  - For example: `app.component.ts` is now `app.ts` and `app.component.html` is now `app.html`.
- The `src` directory contains the main application code (src/app) and other files, like:
  - `index.html`: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the application.
  - `main.ts`: The entry point of the application, where the Angular application is bootstrapped.
  - `styles.css`: Global styles for the application, applied to all components.
- Inside the `src/app` directory, you will find:
  - `app.config.ts`: Configuration settings for the application, such as API endpoints or feature flags.
  - `app.css`: The styles for the main component, defining how it looks.
  - `app.ts`: The root module of the application, which declares and imports other modules and components.
  - `app.html`: The template for the main component, defining the structure of the UI.
  - `app.spec.ts`: The test file for the main component, which contains unit tests to ensure the component behaves as expected.
  - `app.routes.ts`: The routing configuration for the application, defining how different URLs map to components.
