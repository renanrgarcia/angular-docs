# NgModules vs Standalone Components in Angular

- In Angular, there are two primary ways to organize and structure your application: using NgModules or Standalone Components.
- NgModules are the traditional way of organizing Angular applications. They allow you to group related components, directives, pipes, and services into cohesive blocks of functionality. Each NgModule can import other NgModules, making it easy to share functionality across different parts of your application. NgModules also provide a way to configure dependency injection and manage the lifecycle of components.
- Standalone Components, on the other hand, are a newer feature in Angular that allows you to create components that are not tied to any specific NgModule. Standalone Components can be used independently and can be easily shared across different parts of your application without the need for an NgModule. This makes them more flexible and easier to use in certain scenarios, such as when building libraries or reusable components.
- One of the main advantages of using Standalone Components is that they can help reduce the complexity of your application by eliminating the need for NgModules. This can make it easier to understand and maintain your code, especially in larger applications. Standalone Components also allow for better tree-shaking, which can result in smaller bundle sizes and improved performance.

## How to use NgModules

- To use NgModules in your Angular application, you need to create a new NgModule using the `@NgModule` decorator. You can then define the components, directives, pipes, and services that belong to that NgModule using the `declarations`, `imports`, `exports`, and `providers` properties.
- Once you have defined your NgModule, you can import it into other NgModules using the `imports` property. This allows you to share functionality across different parts of your application.
- You can also bootstrap your application using an NgModule by specifying the root component in the `bootstrap` property.

## Example of NgModule

```typescript
import { NgModule } from "@angular/core";
import { BrowserModule } from "@angular/platform-browser";
import { AppComponent } from "./app.component";
import { SharedModule } from "./shared/shared.module";
@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  imports: [BrowserModule, SharedModule],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent],
})
export class AppModule {}
```
