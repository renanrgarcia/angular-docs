# Services

- Services are used to share data and logic across multiple components in an Angular application.
- Services are typically used for tasks such as data fetching, business logic, and state management.
- Services are created using the `@Injectable` decorator, which allows them to be injected into components and other services.
- To create a service, you can use the Angular CLI command: `ng generate service service-name` or `ng g s service-name`.
- Example of creating a service:

```typescript
import { Injectable } from "@angular/core";
@Injectable({
  providedIn: "root",
})
export class ExampleService {
  constructor() {}
}
```

- To use a service in a component, you need to inject it via the component's constructor.
- Example of injecting a service into a component:

```typescript
import { Component } from "@angular/core";
import { ExampleService } from "./example.service";
@Component({
  selector: "app-example",
  templateUrl: "./example.component.html",
  styleUrl: "./example.component.css",
})
export class ExampleComponent {
  constructor(private exampleService: ExampleService) {}
  // Or use:
  // private exampleService = inject(ExampleService);
}
```
