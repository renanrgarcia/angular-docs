# Output Events

- In Angular, output events are used to emit events from a child component to a parent component.
- This is done using the `@Output` decorator in the child component.
- The `EventEmitter` class is used to create an event that can be listened to by the parent component.
- The parent component can then bind to this event using the Angular event binding syntax.
- Example of using `@Output` in a child component:

```typescript
import { Component, EventEmitter, Output } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
  selector: "app-child",
  template: `<button (click)="sendMessage()">Send Message</button>`,
})
export class ChildComponent {
  @Output() messageEvent = new EventEmitter<string>();

  sendMessage() {
    this.messageEvent.emit("Hello from Child");
  }
}
```

- In the parent component, you can listen to this event like so:

```html
<app-child (messageEvent)="receiveMessage($event)"></app-child>
```

## Using "output" function

- Angular also provides a shorthand for defining output events using the `output` function.
- The difference is that it allows you to define the output event without needing to explicitly create an `EventEmitter` instance.

```typescript
import { Component, output } from "@angular/core";
@Component({
  selector: "app-signal-child",
  template: `<button (click)="sendSignal()">Send Signal</button>`,
})
export class SignalChildComponent {
  sendSignal = output<string>("Initial Signal Value");
}
// Parent component
import { Component } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
  selector: "app-parent",
  template: `<app-signal-child
    (sendSignal)="receiveSignal($event)"
  ></app-signal-child>`,
})
export class ParentComponent {
  receiveSignal(value: string) {
    console.log("Received signal:", value);
  }
}
```
