# First Angular App

- `ng new my-first-app`: Create a new Angular application. You will need to answer some prompts about routing and styles.
  - Do you want to create a 'zoneless' application without zone.js (Developer Preview)?
    - This is an experimental feature that allows you to build applications without zone.js, which can improve performance in some cases. For beginners, it's recommended to say `No`.
    - Zone.js is a library that helps Angular manage change detection and asynchronous operations. It allows Angular to know when to update the view when the model changes.
  - Which stylesheet format would you like to use?
    - You can choose from CSS, SCSS, SASS, LESS, or Stylus. For beginners, CSS is a good choice.
  - Do you want to enable Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG/Prerendering)?
    - This is an advanced feature that allows you to render your application on the server for better performance and SEO. For beginners, it's recommended to say `No`.
- `cd my-first-app`: Navigate into the newly created application directory.
- `npm start`: Start the development server. This will compile the application and serve it on `http://localhost:4200/`.
