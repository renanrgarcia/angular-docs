# Angular Concepts

- Angular is front-end framework for building web applications. It's developed and maintained by Google.
- Angular is also a collection of tools and features like CLI, debugging tools, and testing utilities.

## Why Angular?

- It simplifies the development of complex single-page applications (SPAs).
- On Vanilla JavaScript, you would have to manage DOM manipulation, state management, and routing manually. `Imperative programming`.
- Angular provides a `declarative approach` to building UIs, which makes it easier to reason about the application state and behavior.
- Component-based architecture allows for better code organization and reusability.
- OOP principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism can be applied to Angular components.
- Uses TypeScript, which is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other features.

## Angular Evolution

- AngularJS (1.x): The original version of Angular, which was based on JavaScript and introduced the concept of two-way data binding.
- Angular (2+): A complete rewrite of AngularJS, which introduced a component-based architecture and was built with TypeScript.
- Angular 2+ has continued to evolve with regular updates, introducing new features and improvements while maintaining backward compatibility.
- The versions changes every six months, with major releases every 18 months.

## Angular CLI

- `npm install -g @angular/cli`: Install Angular CLI globally.
