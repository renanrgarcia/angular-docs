# Pipes

- Pipes are a way to transform data in Angular templates. They take in data as input and transform it to a desired output format.
- Pipes are used in templates with the pipe operator (`|`).
- Angular provides several built-in pipes, such as `DatePipe`, `UpperCasePipe`, `LowerCasePipe`, `CurrencyPipe`, and more.
- You can also create custom pipes by implementing the `PipeTransform` interface and using the `@Pipe` decorator.
- Example of using a built-in pipe:
  ```html
  <p>{{ birthday | date:'longDate' }}</p>
  ```
- Example of creating a custom pipe:
  ```typescript
  import { Pipe, PipeTransform } from "@angular/core";
  @Pipe({ name: "exclaim" })
  export class ExclaimPipe implements PipeTransform {
    transform(value: string): string {
      return value + "!";
    }
  }
  ```
